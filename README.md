# Incompleteness and Computability

![Book Cover](https://ic.openlogicproject.org/ic.png)

Textbook on GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems and computability
theory, developed for Calgary's Logic III course, based on the Open
Logic Project.  Covers recursive function theory, arithmetization of
syntax, the first and second incompleteness theorem, models of
arithmetic, second-order logic, and the lambda calculus.

This repository/directory only contains the LaTeX files and
illustrations needed to typeset the textbook _Incompleteness
and Computability_, which in turn requires the _[Open Logic
Text](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/)_.

You can [download the
PDF](https://ic.openlogicproject.org/ic-screen.pdf) from the [Open
Logic builds site](https://ic.openlogicproject.org/), or order a
hardcopy from Amazon [[US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1077323395)]
[[CA](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1077323395)]
[[UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1077323395)]

To install and compile:

- Download/install the _Open Logic Text_ from
  [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/), including
  [photos](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/photos) if you want those.
- Navigate to the subdirectory `courses/`
- Put the content of this repository into a subdirectory of it, say
  `courses/incompleteness-computability`.

If you use `git`, this should do it:
```
# git clone https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic.git
# cd OpenLogic/courses
# git clone https://github.com/rzach/incompleteness-computability.git
# cd ../assets
# git clone https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/portraits.git
# git clone https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/photos.git
```
Inside `courses/incompleteness-computability`, you can now compile:
```
# pdflatex ic-screen
```
or just `# make` if you have `latexmk` installed. (You'll also have to
do `bibtex ic-screen` for the bibliography.)

The file `ic-screen.tex` produces a color version of the text with
smaller margins for screen reading. `ic-print` produces a
black-and-white version designed for printing on Crown Quarto stock
(without cover).

The file loads `ic.tex`, which contains the actual material. It
in turn includes other files, most of them from the `OpenLogic`
repository. So you won't get a complete book unless you download into
the right subdirectory of and compile from there.
